# workshop-template-b

`{{ title }}` is a Jekyll template for a simple workshop website, with a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)-based theme, designed for hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Works best for about 5 pages of instructions, plus an index page, all written in Markdown. 
The navigation to the main pages is exposed at top and bottom of each page for easy stepping through the sections.
